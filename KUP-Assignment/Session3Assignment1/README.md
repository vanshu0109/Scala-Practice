We have to craete a banking application and perform following things in this assignment - 

Create a banking application using Map[Long, Double] 

account number -> Long
account balance -> Double
case class Transactions(transactionId: Long, accountNumber: Long, transactionType: String, amount: Double)

Create methods for following operations:
Create new account by allocating random account number and depositing balance in account
def createAccount(openingBalance: Double): Map[Long, Double] = ???
List all accounts with balance
def listAccounts(): Map[Long, Double] = ???
Fetch account balance using account number
def fetchAccountBalance(accountNumber: Long): Double = ???

You have a list of Transactions having account number, transaction type (credit/debit) and amount. Create a method to update account balance that will take List of Transactions, as per transaction type it will credit or debit amount in account (Use Pattern matching)

def updateBalance(transactions: List[Transactions]): Map[Long, Int] = ???
Delete account using account number
def deleteAccount(accountNumber: Long): Boolean = ???
